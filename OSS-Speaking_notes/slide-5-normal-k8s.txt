So, to summarize, we have the master and worker nodes

On the master node, we have the ETCD data store which stores information about the cluster, we have the kube scheduler that is responsible for scheduling applications or microservices or containers on node

We have different controllers that take care of different functions like the node controller, replication controller etc.  We have the kube api server that is responsible for orchestrating all operations within the cluster

On the worker nodes, we have the kubelet that listens for instructions from the kube-api server and manages containers and the kube-proxy service that helps in enabling communication between services within the cluster
